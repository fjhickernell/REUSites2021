\section{Overview} 

SURE will engage undergraduate students---\emph{especially those from underrepresented groups and academic institutions where research opportunities are limited}---in innovative computational mathematics and machine learning research.  SURE students will participate in active research groups.  They will learn to work independently and creatively. They will acquire both ``hard'' academic skills and ``soft'' communication and teamwork skills.  SURE students will be prepared and inspired to pursue graduate study in mathematics, statistics, or a related field in preparation for research careers in academia or industry.

SURE will involve \emph{ten undergraduate students, five faculty mentors, and two graduate students} each Summer for three years at the Illinois Institute of Technology (Illinois Tech).  SURE participants will engage in a \emph{ten-week program from May to July}, working in groups of three or fewer based on the students’ preference, under the supervision of faculty mentors and with the assistance of graduate students. Faculty mentors will continue to advise SURE participants during the following academic year to write up their results for publication, and to support them as they transition into graduate schools. In addition, SURE will provide financial support for students to present their research results at professional conferences and workshops.
(SURE will preferably run on-site, but be prepared to go virtual or hybrid if public health conditions require so.)

\subsection{Objectives} The acronym SURE plays a dual role in highlighting our objectives.

\begin{figure}[bh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 14cm]{SURE_1_3.png}
    \caption{Objectives of {\bf S}ummer {\bf U}ndergraduate {\bf R}esearch {\bf E}xperience Program}
    \label{fig:sure_obj}
\end{figure}

SURE students will be trained as \uppercase{\textbf{skillful}} researchers with important computational and data skills. 
We will prioritize recruiting \uppercase{\textbf{underrepresented}} students, including women, underrepresented racial minorities, and students with disabilities. 
SURE students will explore 
\uppercase{\textbf{Real-world}} research problems and learn to pose questions, collect preliminary findings, modify their questions as necessary, and pursue answers. 
SURE students will learn to 
be \uppercase{\textbf{effective}} in communication, teamwork,  professionalism, and responsibility. 
With the support of our Illinois Tech family and other community members, we are dedicated to achieve these objectives via the plans and means described in this proposal. 

%\begin{itemize}



%\item SURE students will be trained as \uppercase{\textbf{skillful}} researchers with important computational and data skills.  This will be done not only through their research projects but also through tutorials and workshops tailored to fill the gaps in their preparation and help them understand the cutting edge of the problems that they are tackling.  Graduate students and faculty will engage in individual mentoring. The skills they learn will prepare them to be successful researchers at the PhD level. 
\iffalse Fred: this looks like part E
Tutorials, workshops, and projects will train participants with state-of-the-art techniques and computer skills. A series of short
training workshops (Workshop Series) will be held for students to design posters/presentations, and to
inform them of graduate and professional opportunities. 
The program will also enhance their curricular
activities, heighten engagement in their field of study and prepare a solid background for them to pursue an advanced degree. This
program aims to achieve a long-term positive impact on their career decisions to pursue academic and
professional careers in STEM disciplines.
\fi

%\item SURE will heavily recruit \uppercase{\textbf{underrepresented}} students, including women, underrepresented racial minorities, and students with disabilities.  A few such students may come from Illinois Tech, but others will come from the minority-serving institutions (MSIs) in Chicagoland or elsewhere with personal reasons for spending the summer in Chicago.  
%\item SURE students will explore \uppercase{\textbf{Real-world}} research problems. They will learn to pose questions, collect preliminary findings, modify their questions as necessary, and pursue answers.  Mentors will help them think through why a question might be important or interesting and what steps might be taken to answer it.  However, the SURE students will be allowed to explore questions for which we cannot be assured of their success in finding the answer. \scnote{Change ``be assured'' to ``assure''?}

%\item SURE students will learn to be \uppercase{\textbf{effective}} in communication, teamwork,  professionalism, and responsibility.  SURE students will learn to communicate what they are doing to various audiences: their team members, mathematicians unfamiliar with their work, and their friends and family who are not mathematically literate.  They will learn to work with team members who may have culturally different ways of working or communicating.  Presentations by Illinois Tech experts in responsible conduct of research, Title IX, and diversity, equity, and inclusion will strengthen their ethical foundation.
%\end{itemize}


\subsection{Targeted Student Participants}\label{sec:targetstd}
The targeted student participants will primarily be rising third or fourth year undergraduates with a  background
in mathematics and statistics, including at least univariate calculus and programming.  Students from \hypertarget{MSIlink} Minority Serving Institutions (\MSIs) and institutions with limited research opportunities will be given high priority.   Undergraduate students that are veterans of the US armed services and first-generation college students will also be given priority. We will admit our undergraduates according to the following profile: 
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
 \item \emph{At least 60\%} from underrepresented groups including women, racial minorities, and persons with disabilities;
 \item \emph{At least 30\%} underrepresented racial minorities;
 \item \emph{At least half} from academic institutions where research opportunities are limited
(including two-year colleges), and 
\item \emph{At least 60\%} from outside Illinois Tech.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Intellectual Focus}
The intellectual focus of the proposed research consists of deterministic, stochastic, statistical, and financial models,
development of mathematical and statistical algorithms, 
generation of new methods in risk models, multivariate integration, energetic variational inference, pattern formation, and option pricing. The program will engage SURE
participants in the model development, algorithm design, data sampling, analysis, and implementation
of mathematical, statistical, and computational methods, especially as they apply to specific problems
in the real world. The proposed research projects in this program are particularly designed to stimulate
the research interests of SURE participants in applied  mathematics, statistics, and computational
methods to important problems in the real world and to inspire them to pursue graduate education.

\subsection{Organizational Structure and Program Management}
\hypertarget{YDlink}
PI Yuhan Ding (\YD) will serve as Program Director to oversee the management of the SURE
program. \hypertarget{FHlink} Co-PI Fred Hickernell (\FH) will serve as Co-Director to assist
with day-to-day activities and monitor the research progress of the students during and after the program.  \YD
and \FH will serve as faculty mentors along with three senior Illinois Tech personnel: \hypertarget{SCTClink}Sou-Cheng Choi (\SCTC), \hypertarget{LKlink}Lulu Kang (\LK), and \hypertarget{SLlink}Shuwang Li (\SL). Two graduate students will assist SURE participants with mathematical questions or technical issues with MATLAB/R/Python or other software. All faculty
mentors are from the Department of Applied Mathematics in the College of Computing at
Illinois Tech.

\subsection{A Pilot  Program in 2021 Summer}

A \emph{seven-week}, internally funded pilot program was hosted remotely in the summer of 2021, which involved \emph{six faculty mentors and seven undergraduate students}. This program was a collaboration between the departments of applied mathematics and computer science. Each student received a \$500 weekly stipend. \YD, the pilot program coordinator, handled the selection of students and mentors, coordination of hybrid gatherings, social activities, and final presentations. \FH, \LK, and \SL served as mentors. \emph{Two of the undergraduates were racial minorities, four were female, one was a sexual minority, and three were first-generation college students.} All students provided very positive feedback about the program.
The detailed program information and comments from the participants can be found in \cite{SUREWeb}.

\subsection{Timetable}
\emph{Recruitment (from Fall to Spring):} Efforts will be made to increase the visibility of the program to undergraduate students, especially those from traditionally underrepresented groups and research limited institutions. Applications received before the 3rd Monday of January will be given full consideration, but applications will be accepted until all slots are filled. Selection of the participants via potential Skype/Zoom interviews will begin in February. Decisions and offers will be made by the end of February. Students will be asked to respond to the offer within two weeks of notification, but no earlier than the March 8 common deadline for mathematics REUs. If any student declines, an alternate offer will be made to another applicant. 
 
\noindent\emph{SURE program (10 weeks from
May to July):} 
The detailed
information is in Section \ref{sec:SURESchedule}.
%On Day 1, the research projects will be presented to SURE participants along with physical and biological background and an overview of some of the mathematical, statistical, or computational techniques involved in the project. Weeks 1-2 of the program will be devoted to tutorials/workshops/courses given by faculty mentors/graduate students to provide the participants with the necessary technical tools including some short courses, open scholarship,  computer skills, and background introduction to begin the projects. By the end of Week 2, students will have decided on a research project with the assistance of their assigned faculty mentor during the admission and present the initial problems they work with on Week 3 and midterm progress on Week 6 or 7. During Week 9, students will begin writing their conclusions and preparing a poster presentation. In Week 10, students will finalize their reports and poster presentations. SURE Poster Day will be held on the last morning, where each student or group of students describes their problem and explains their main findings to other students and faculty viewing their poster.

\noindent\emph{Follow-up (from Fall to Spring):} During the following academic year, SURE participants will be connected to faculty mentors and graduate students through regularly scheduled Skype/Zoom meetings and emails as they continue to finalize their manuscripts for publication. The papers will be submitted to conference proceedings and academic journals for publication. In addition, SURE will financially support the participants to present their work at professional conferences and workshops, especially venues that host undergraduate research sessions, such as Mathematical Association of America (MAA) MathFest, Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM), and Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) annual meeting. Students will be advised to take classes that reinforce or supplement the topics covered during the summer program and to potentially take courses such as an independent study or senior thesis to obtain research credit for their project. Students will be coached to apply for graduate study.

\subsection{Organizations' Commitments to the REU site}
The program will be strongly supported by the Department of Applied Mathematics and College of Computing at Illinois Tech. The department has committed to providing SURE participants with office space, discussion and tutorial classrooms, and access to computer equipment, printers, and the internet at no charge for the on-site program. The college has committed to providing the locations for the presentations and poster day. Two graduate students will help with the tutorial/lab sessions each year for the duration of the program. The Office of Community Affairs and Outreach Programs at Illinois Tech will leverage relationships with City Colleges Of Chicago to
advertise SURE to students in those institutions.
We also have external collaborators will help us recruit students and promote SURE at their institution: Chicago State University (CSU), Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and Wheaton College.
The Office of Enrollment will fully support the process of the application, admission, registration, and on-campus housing. 
The Office of Research Integrity and Compliance will provide a presentation on \emph{Responsible Conduct of Research} to all SURE program participants. The Office of Title IX Compliance will help all SURE students, faculty mentors, and graduate students understand how to prevent sexual harassment and how respond if it occurs.


\section{Nature of Student Activities: Logistics}
\subsection{SURE Program Schedule}
\label{sec:SURESchedule}
Each SURE student will be
assigned a mentor and research area based on their preference during admission. SURE students and their faculty
mentors will communicate in real time through Slack or similar platform. 

\noindent \emph{Weeks 1-2: Project Selection and Short Courses/Tutorials/Workshops.}
Day 1 is orientation. In the morning,  all participants, faculty mentors, and two graduate students will introduce themselves. After that, mentors will present several sample project topics for students to choose.
Students will have a tour of the Illinois Tech campus and facilities before lunch. In the afternoon of Day 1,
presentations related to research integrity and authorship will be given.

In the next a few days,
SURE participants will take several short courses that are important for the projects, such as linear algebra, probability, and statistics. We will also offer some programming software tutorials for MATLAB, R, Python.

A workshop series on library search, poster and presentation design,
research report/paper writing, technical writing (including LaTeX), application and admission for
graduate programs, and strategies for being successful in academic careers, etc.\ will be organized to run through the ten weeks.  Students will also learn tools for open scholarship and reproducible research, such as GitHub, SpeakerDeck, FigShare, Overleaf, and arXiv.   More than one discussion of Title IX compliance will be held throughout the ten weeks.  

All of these courses, tutorials, and workshops will be delivered by faculty mentors, graduate students, or Illinois staff experts.

By the end of Week 2, a research project will be decided for each group of three students or fewer with the help of their faculty mentors.

\noindent \emph{Weeks 3-8: Research Activity.}
SURE participants will be given additional background
reading material and practice with computer software to initiate their projects. All participants will be encouraged to write blogs \cite{Hig21a} during the program. This will help them learn to articulate their research problem and their findings to a more general audience. Faculty mentors and graduate
students will have regular meetings with SURE students a couple of times a week. Faculty mentors and graduate students will also communicate with SURE students via some project management software, such as Slack or ZenHub, to check on student progress and to address any questions. 
\emph{On the Friday of Week 3,}
each student or group of students will make a 20-minute presentation to all where they will describe the problem they are working on and their plans for the next couple of weeks. Faculty mentors and
graduate students will provide guidance not only on their approach but on how to explain what they are doing.
\emph{On the Friday of Week 6 or Week 7,}
each student or group of students will give a 20-min midterm presentation to all to show the progress made so far, challenges encountered, and help needed. Faculty mentors,
graduate students, and their peers will give feedback and guidance.

\noindent \emph{Weeks 9-10: Manuscripts Writing and Presentation/Poster Designing.} SURE students will start to
write manuscripts in Week 9. More time will be spent on finalizing their manuscripts, preparing presentations, and designing posters during Week 10. SURE Poster Day will be held on the morning of the last day. Each student or group of students will give a poster presentation followed by an ending ceremony of the program. Each student will receive a certificate of participation from  SURE.

\subsection{Interaction Activities}
\subsubsection{Student-Faculty Interaction}
In addition to communication via Slack or email, weekly SURE group meetings will foster student-faculty interactions.  Each
faculty mentor will discuss their ongoing projects with their SURE students so that students understand the broader context of their research. Regular research group seminars
will offer SURE students opportunities to learn state-of-the-art research topics and interact
with the invited speakers.
Biweekly meetings among faculty mentors
will discuss the progress of SURE students to detect potential problems and allow
timely adjustments to improve the overall success of the program.

\subsubsection{SURE Participant-Graduate Student Interaction}
Two graduate students selected from the PhD students
of the faculty mentors will assist SURE participants. They will
directly assist students with mathematics and statistics-related
concepts, discuss the projects, and offer suggestions. On-site SURE participants will be provided
a shared office populated by the graduate students which
allows greater interaction between the two groups. 

\subsubsection{Student-Student Communication}
SURE students will conduct timely discussions through Slack or
other online communication for the virtual program.
On-Site social activities will be organized to provide recreation
and build team-cooperation relationships for all involved participants: (1) Orientation luncheon; (2) Weekly SURE group Math Tea time; (3) Field trips; (4) BBQ
cookout; (4) Baseball games;  (5) SURE Poster Day reception.

\section{Nature of student Activities: Sample Projects }
SURE students will participate in research projects under the supervision of faculty mentors. Faculty
mentors have designed projects with several possible levels of completion to ensure that SURE participants
make independent research contributions, gain valuable research experience, and enjoy a feeling of
accomplishment after achieving their research objectives. Five sample research projects are described.

\section{The Research Environment}

\subsection{Faculty Mentors}
This program involves five faculty
mentors in the Department of Applied Mathematics at
Illinois Tech. Three are women faculty mentors (\YD, \SCTC, and \LK). All faculty mentors are
active in their fields and have extensive experience in mentoring undergraduate students, ensuring the quality of mentoring activities and the success of the program. 
Faculty mentors will maintain contact and communication with their advising students through Zoom/Skype. The participants also have chances to do long-term research with the guidance of their mentors.

\noindent \underline{\textit{PI Yuhan Ding}}  has a track record in the field of computational and applied
mathematics and has published several articles related to adaptive algorithms in function approximations and implemented the adaptive algorithms in a toolbox GAIL~\cite{
ChoEtal21a} built on MATLAB. She provided some tutorials to undergraduate students when she was a PhD student. She advised three students in summer research course in 2019. One of them was a female. Two students were accepted to a master's program at Brandeis University (a female) in 2020 and Delft University of Technology in 2021.

\noindent \underline{\textit{Co-PI Fred Hickernell}} has supervised 16 PhD students, a handful of master's thesis students, and a couple of dozen undergraduate research students.  He has authored over a hundred refereed publications, including \cite{ChoEtal22a,HicEtal14b,LiHic03a,SonRidFasHic10a} with five undergraduate students.  Undergraduate students mentored by \FH have gone on to graduate programs at Johns Hopkins, Princeton U, RPI (an African-American), U Illinois Chicago (a Latina), and UCLA. \FH is a Fellow of the IMS and has served on the editorial boards of several computational mathematics journals. 

\noindent\underline{\textit{Sou-Cheng Choi}} \input{about_sc.tex}

\noindent \underline{\textit{Lulu Kang}} has mentored six applied math and computer science undergraduate students on various topics in statistics and machine learning since 2018. Most of them were female and/or minority students. In the past decade, she has advised eight M.S. students and two PhD students on their theses on various topics in statistics and related areas. \LK has also been active in community outreach by advising three high school students on applied statistics and machine learning projects. 
\LK has worked on various areas in Statistics and Machine Learning, including uncertainty quantification, statistical design and analysis of experiments, Bayesian inference, etc. 
\LK has developed and taught many statistical courses including Statistical Learning, Bayesian Computational Statistics, and Regression and Forecasting, etc. She is also the co-founder and Associate Program Director of the Data Science Program at Illinois Tech. \LK is currently the associate editor for journals \emph{SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty Quantification} and \emph{Technometrics}.

\noindent \underline{\textit{Shuwang Li}} has supervised eight PhD students and five master's students with thesis option. \SL also mentored six undergraduates including students from other universities (doing research with \SL during summer). The two female undergraduate students went to graduate schools at Columbia and Ohio State,  and one of them published a joint paper with \SL at {\it SIAM Undergraduate Research Online} (SIURO). 
\SL is an expert in the theoretical analyses and
long-time adaptive simulations of free boundary problems in  fluids and
materials. \SL developed a novel time-space
rescaling scheme that enables one to simulate evolving interfaces for much
longer times than had been previously possible, which led to the discovery of new nonlinear
phenomena: self-similar universal patterns in growing crystals and Hele-Shaw  flows. \SL also incorporates advanced numerical techniques on interface problems into special topics that are accessible to undergraduates. 

 
 
\subsection{The Host Institute}
Illinois Tech is a private research university with an enrollment of 6,342. It has a significant minority student enrollment (around 19\% American Indian or Alaskan Native, Black or African American, Hispanic/Latino of any race, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and two or more races) and 37\% of the students are female. The College of Computing
and the Department of Applied Mathematics at Illinois Tech offer a series of programs to involve students
in research. The department offers Master of Science Degrees
in both Applied Mathematics and Statistics, a Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Applied Mathematics.  Illinois Tech is a diverse and welcoming community, featuring a campus with students from 89 countries and all 50 states. In 1890 the university was founded in order to lift up people of all backgrounds with an education that would help them meet the needs of the age. Ensuring every student at Illinois Tech being afforded that opportunity is of the utmost importance.
We strive to have a diverse culture of unity, inclusivity, equity, and respect.

\subsection{Housing and Campus Life} For the campus-based portion of SURE, students
will reside in Illinois Tech McCormick Student Village or State Street Village. The furnished halls are suite-style offering students the
convenience to interact with one another outside of the program. The halls provide WiFi, laundry
lounges, and meeting rooms. The McCormick Tribune Campus Center provides a large variety of dining options. Illinois Tech will provide the access to all facilities to the SURE participants. 

\section{Student Recruitment and Selection}
\subsection{Student Recruitment} A website and a flyer will be designed to introduce the program including the start date and application deadline of the program, program requirement,  
all available projects, faculty mentors, a link to the application system, the department, and Illinois Tech, etc. The Office of Community Affairs and Outreach Programs at Illinois Tech and our collaborators NEIU, CSU, and Wheaton College  will provide strong support in recruiting students and advertising the program. In addition,
efforts will be made to 
\emph{increase the visibility of this program}: 
(1) 
The URL of the program’s
website \cite{SUREWeb} will be posted in the list of NSF-funded REU Sites. 
(2) The flyer will be posted on publications associated with ACM/IEEE chapters, Focus of MAA, AWM
Newsletter, NAM Newsletter, and Math Horizons and also in the Illinois Tech campus newspaper, bulletin, and electronic boards.
(3) 
The PIs will attach the flyer to emails sent to
chairs and undergraduate mentors in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at institutions in the US, especially
\MSIs and research-limited institutions, with a request to distribute the flyer to their undergraduates. 
(4) Faculty mentors will attend (in person or remotely)
the annual JMM, MathFest, NAM, and other professional conferences to advertise the
program and distribute the flyer. In addition, faculty mentors will contact their colleagues and alumni with a request to
distribute the flyer to their undergraduate classes.

Extra effort will be made to 
\emph{make the program visible to underrepresented groups}.
Faculty mentors will attend (or participate remotely) the annual meeting of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanic and Native Americans in Science  (SACNAS) and Association of Women in Mathematics (AWM)
to advertise the program.
Faculty mentors will visit 
\MSIs near Illinois Tech to advertise the program.
 Faculty from underrepresented groups in the College of Computing will contact colleagues at \MSIs to advertise our
 program and distribute the flyer.
 

\subsection{Application and Selection} Each applicant will start an application from the link on the program’s
website and submit the following materials: 
Contact information, citizenship status, expected graduation date, GPA, college transcripts (especially courses and computer skills related to the program),
optional minority status, optional sexual information, and optional first-generation-in-college status;
At least one recommendation
letters from faculty members; 
One essay regarding their experience with, and interest in, research and in particular research projects, reasons for being involved in this program, their future
education and career plans, and how they feel the program will facilitate their plans. 

A recruitment committee consisting of all faculty mentors will review applications and rate the students. Students
will be rated based on GPA, courses, and skills related to the program, letters of recommendation,
research interests, career objectives, and demographics information. Faculty mentors
will develop a rubric to be used to guide the selection
process. This rubric will focus the team on relevant student prior performances, aiming to reduce the
influence of unconscious bias. The demographics information will ensure at least 60\% of the SURE students
from outside Illinois Tech for a diverse demographical distribution. Skype/Zoom interviews will be conducted
with several highly ranked students to discuss their interests in the program and to identify faculty
mentors prior to their acceptance. In order to provide each SURE participant with the attention needed,
each faculty mentor will be the primary mentor for at most three SURE participants. Based on the
discussions with highly qualified students and with priorities given to those from the underrepresented
groups and research-limited institutions, a total of ten students will be selected.

\section{Student and Mentor Professional Development}
\subsection{Student Professional Development}
\FH as the Vice Provost for Research will invite a colleague in the  Office of Research to make a presentation on
\emph{Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)} to address: (1) the integrity of research; (2) authorship;  (3) good behavior
and quality research conduct; (4) bad behavior such as fabrication of data, falsification of data and
plagiarism; and (5) the ethics and associated with the responsibilities of mentoring, peer relationships, review
\& publication, data management, and conflicts of interest. After the presentation, we will have group discussions with some scenarios to help students understand RCR better.
All students will be required to complete one RCR training course provided by Illinois Tech through CITI.  In addition, we will invite a librarian at Illinois Tech to give a presentation regarding the \emph{reproducible research and open scholarship} to address: (1) the advantages of  reproducible research, (2) how to make your research work publicly available to others, and
(3) how to share your raw data or code.


 \subsection{Mentor Professional Development}
The colleague in the Office of Research Integrity and Compliance will also make a presentation on efficient mentoring for all faculty and graduate student mentors to address: (1) case studies
of mentor abuses; (2) responsibilities of mentors; (3) the strength and weakness of different types of
students and how these can challenge mentors, etc. In addition, \YD will conduct at least one face-to-face RCR discussion session. \YD will hold a formal RCR instruction session, or conduct informal RCR instruction as topics arise during the natural course of research activities with other faculty mentors and graduate students. 

\subsection{Creating a Safe and Respectful Environment} 
We will invite Virginia D.\ Foster, Title IX Compliance Coordinator to present Title IX Compliance to all the SURE students, faculty mentors, and graduate students about
(1) matters related to sexual harassment,
(2) the university policy regarding matters related to sexual harassment,
(3) the appropriate way to react
(4) expectations of behavior on campus. Afterward, Virginia will provide several scenarios and lead a group discussion to help students understand Title IX better. We are committed to creating an environment for all participants that is fair, humane, and respectful.

\section{Project Evaluation and Reporting}
The proposed external evaluation will be led by \hypertarget{SAlink}{Dr.~Shlomo Argamon} (\SA) (see supplementary document for
SA’s expertise). He has  been a PI on multiple
NSF grants. He will work directly with the SURE team on the implementation of the evaluation
plan.  \SA will author the annual evaluation report including results and improvement recommendations. The SURE team will respond to these reports in written form, documenting
the impact on the program. The conceptual model of the evaluation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:my_label}. \SA will also implement an audit of the implementation process
to ensure the program is implemented with integrity. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses are
planned as follows.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 14cm]{EvaluationPlan.png}
    \caption{Conceptual Model of the Evaluation}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Evaluation of Short Term Outcomes}

We will use survey form, feedback, and document review to evaluate the short term outcomes. The questions in the survey that comprise these instruments will be developed under the leadership of the \SA and faculty mentors to address the objectives.
\subsubsection{Produce Skillful Researchers} \label{sec:hardskill}
The research capability will be measured quantitatively in four parts: learning new algorithms, identifying the problem, formulating the problem, and identifying the approaches.
Students will be asked to assess themselves in these four parts within a range 0 to 10 before and after the program. Faculty mentors will use the same survey to evaluate the students’ research capability after the first two-week program and re-assess the students’ capability after the program based on their performance in the project.
The results of these assessments will provide a way to measure the improvement of the students' knowledge skills and research capabilities. Based on the analyses of the results, the faculty mentors will adjust the topics and designs of the courses, tutorials,  and workshops to enhance the training in the specific areas in the next year's program.
We will also collect feedback from the students after tutorials/workshop/seminars. This feedback will provide more direct ideas on how to organize these activities efficiently.

\subsubsection{Increase the Involvement of Underrepresented Groups}
We will track the demographic information of the applicants and participants. We expect that at least 40\% of the applicants will be from the underrepresented groups. If we can't meet the targeted rate, we will spend more effort in recruiting students from \MSIs and research-limited institutions and advertising SURE next year. For the admitted students, we will check the percentage of each underrepresented group and compare to the criterion in Section \ref{sec:targetstd}. All the numbers, suggestions and new strategies will be documented in the annual report. 

\subsubsection{
Inspire Students' Research Interests to Explore Real-world Problems}

A survey regarding the program's influence will be collected from SURE participants at the end of the program. The participants will be asked about the gain from the program, any change of their future education and career plans after the program, and suggestion to the program. \SA will compare the acquired information with the motivation and career plans in the application materials. The result will provide the short-term influence of SURE program on their career path.

\subsubsection{Teach Effective Communicators and Team Players}

``Soft'' skills, such as communications and teamwork will be assessed by the participants before and after the program. In addition, the assessment will be collected from the faculty mentors and two graduate students at the end of the second week and after the program. The same methodology as in Section \ref{sec:hardskill} will be implemented here. 


\subsection{Evaluation of Long Term Outcomes}

SURE participants will be
asked to complete follow-up surveys via email or communication with their mentors. We will also track a randomly selected control group from the applicants who are not admitted to the program. SA will compare the percentage in advanced degrees and number of published papers in these two groups and draw conclusions. The results will be used to determine whether SURE program has an impact on participants' education and career decisions or not.


\subsection{Evaluation of Implementation of the Program}
 All application materials and selection rubric will be shared
with \SA after the students are selected. \SA will review
these materials and  compare the selected students to the established
rubric and verify that the rubric criterion has been followed. For comparison purposes, \SA will also
review the applicants who were not selected. Identified deviations will be immediately drawn to the
attention of the selection committee. The most effective recruitment methods will be expanded in the
years that follow while the less effective methods will be redesigned or removed. Schedules, participation logs, possible research projects and peer-reviewed papers will be maintained and provided to \SA. These documents will be reviewed to determine whether the program was implemented in the manner
as it was proposed.
 
\section{Intellectual Merit}
The intellectual merit of the proposed work consists of (1) development of new computational finance methods to address financial crisis based on ESG scores; (2)
new and efficient methods in Monte Carlo sampling and development of corresponding algorithms and software based on these methods; (3) development of new energetic variational inference approach for machine learning ; (4) 
implement RQMC and the least square regression in pricing American options and comparison with other variance reduction methods; (5) development of a model in controlling nonlinear interface instability in Hele-Shaw flows and identifying critical physical parameters (critical evolution time and interface size) via a machine learning approach to achieve a dynamical equilibrium state and potential applications in physics and biology.
The proposed research will build on current results and contribute to new mathematical, statistical,
and computational methods, algorithm design, analysis, data collection, and implementation to address
important and complex problems in real life. New codes or algorithms will be made publicly
available on the program’s website and some open scholarships.

\section{Broader Impacts}
\begin{sloppypar}\Upara{Providing Research Experiences for Undergraduate} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
SURE will promote advanced training in STEM
disciplines. The student-centered learning-researching modules will enhance participants’ knowledge in
mathematics and statistics and develop their capabilities in conducting independent research. This program will make a deliberate effort to diverse research environments by targeting female and underrepresented minority students as well as students from less research-focused institutions. \end{sloppypar}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Upara{Preparing Students for Professional and Partnership Development} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
SURE is committed to promoting research in computational mathematics and statistics and motivating undergraduates to pursue graduate careers in STEM disciplines and will also help current students land competitive jobs in the business world. Our training in the areas of computation and software development gives our students the needed edge in comparison to other mathematics graduates. SURE participants from different institutions through a series of educational and social activities will enhance their professional development and begin to form a network of partners with similar intellectual interests and goals. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Upara{Improving Illinois Tech}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The Department of Applied Mathematics at Illinois Tech is committed to build a strong applied mathematics program with computational mathematics and data science as a major research area. 
SURE will generate more momentum and stimuli for our teaching and research in this area. We will attract more underrepresented undergraduate students to this research area. Through the SURE and the teaching and research materials/outcomes, we can add new components on computational mathematics and data science to the existing courses Math 478 Computational Mathematics, Math 569 Statistical Learning, Math 565 Monte Carlo Methods, and others. 
We expect that students will establish a lasting interest in research in the interdisciplinary areas of mathematics and data science.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Upara{Community Impact}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Illinois Tech is committed to serve working-class people. 
It has been ranked \#1 in Illinois and \#32 in the nation for lifting students from families in the bottom 20\% of income to the top 20\% \cite{IITrank}. 
The faculty and administration of Illinois Tech have been creating many innovative programs to achieve, such as the experiential learning opportunities offered by the existing Elevate Program \cite{IITElevate}.
The proposed SURE program is different from the existing programs since it is more research oriented whereas some other existing programs are more knowledge-learning oriented. 
We believe the proposed SURE program will fill a gap in training the research capabilities and enhance the broader impacts of Illinois Tech on its neighboring communities. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Upara{Disseminating Research and Poster Presentation at Conferences}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The research in SURE will result in publications in peer-reviewed journals in applied mathematics, computer science, statistics, and machine learning. These journals will include both those that emphasize theory and those that emphasize applications. Illinois Tech  SURE students will join some national conferences such as MAA MathFest, JMM, and SIAM annual meeting, etc, to present the results of their work.

\fi

\FH, \SCTC, \YD, \XT, \YZ developed several adaptive algorithms for univariate integration, function approximation, and optimization \cite{ChoEtal17a,HicEtal14b,  Din15a, Ton14a, Zha18a}.  Those constructed by \FH, \SCTC, \YD, and \XT in \cite{ChoEtal17a} are \emph{locally adaptive}---the nonuniform sampling density is influenced by the function data.  For function approximation, the computational cost of $\Order\left(\sqrt{\norm[1/2]{f''}/\varepsilon} \right)$, where $\varepsilon$ is the error tolerance, and is essentially optimal. 
\FH, \LlAJR, \DL, and \JR developed globally adaptive algorithms for approximating $\int_{[0,1]^d} f(\bx) \, \dif \bx$ based on LD sequences \cite{HicJim16a,HicEtal17a,JimHic16a}. 
\FH, \YD, \LlAJR, and collaborators investigated function approximation problems for Banach spaces, $\calf$, defined by series representations \cite{DinHic20a,DinEtal20a}.  Adaptive function approximation algorithms constructed were shown to be essentially optimal.

\Upara{Recruitment and Application Materials} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
All recruitment and application materials will be shared
with \SA before and after implementation, including the applicant selection rubric. \SA will review
the application materials and the selection rubric, and provide formative feedback to faculty mentors
before the materials are distributed and before students are selected. After the students are selected
but before they are formally accepted, \SA will compare the selected students to the established
rubric and verify that the rubric criterion has been followed. For comparison purposes, \SA will also
review the applicants who were not selected. Identified deviations will be immediately drawn to the
attention of the selection committee. The most effective recruitment methods will be expanded in the
years that follow while the less effective methods will be redesigned or removed. \SA will review the
recruitment process and results of the process for summative purposes. Baseline data will be collected
concerning students’ prior mathematics and statistics courses, computer skills, and research experiences.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Upara{Survey Forms} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Surveys will be administered to SURE participants and faculty mentors before, during, and after the program. The questions that comprise these instruments will be developed under the leadership of the evaluator and faculty mentors to address the objectives.
Students will be asked to assess their research capability in identifying the problem, formulating the problem, identifying the approaches,  learning new algorithms, and communicating with others before and after the program.
Faculty mentors will use the same survey to evaluate the students' research capability after the first two-week program. Faculty mentors will re-assess the students' capability based on their performance in the project after the program.
The feedback of these two assessments will provide a way to measure the development of the students' knowledge skills and research capabilities in mathematics and statistics. If the development in some areas is quite limited, we will adjust the design of the workshops and tutorials to enhance the training in the specific areas in next year's program.
In addition, SURE participants' intention to pursue a research career will be collected in the survey before and after the program. Participants' response on how does SURE affect their career choice will also be collected. 
SURE participants will also be asked to complete follow-up surveys via email or communication with their mentors, concerning a longer-term program impact on their education and
career decisions. All this information will be used to track SURE participants into their careers aiming
to gauge the degree to which the program has been a lasting influence on SURE students’ career paths.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Upara{Document Review} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Application materials,  schedules,  possible research projects, and peer-reviewed papers will be maintained and provided
to \SA. These documents will be reviewed to determine whether the program was implemented
in the manner that it was proposed. Information acquired will be used to improve this
program. The papers co-authored by SURE participants will be used for summative evaluation, including
their development in knowledge and research skills. Application materials will also be examined to
determine whether SURE participants who successfully published peer-reviewed papers had entered this
program with different background knowledge or experiences than those that did not.
In addition, we will track the percentage of our targeted group of applicants and participants. If in some groups, the percentage is quite low, we will spend more effort on advising our program in that group. The annual report will also address whether we reach the targeted percentage or not. If not, \SA will suggest several ways to be conducted in the next year.
